#1) Define a function that subtracts the second number from the first number. Return the result.

#2) Define a function that divides a number by 2, multiplies it by 77, and then adds 10000. Return the result.

#3) Define a function that checks if two numbers are equal. If they are equal, return true. If they are not equal, return false.

#4) Define a function that takes in two numbers and returns the larger number. If they are the same, it should just return that number.

#5) Define a function that takes in two words and returns a string that contains both words combined.

#6) Define a function that takes in three numbers. If the first number is equal to the second OR the third number, return true. Else, return false.

#7) Define a function that prints your name.

#8) Define a function that takes in a string that is the name of a color. If that string is equal to your favorite color, it prints "That's my favorite color!" If it is not, it prints "That is not my favorite color. Try again."

#9) Define a function that takes in a number. If the number is not equal to zero, the function runs a loop until the number reaches 0. HINT: Within the loop, keep subtracting 1 from the number.

'''YOUR OWN FUNCTION'''

#10) Create your own function that solves any problem you can think of.
